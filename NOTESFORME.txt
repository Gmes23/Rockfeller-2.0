Searchbar not working due to api not working 

- NOTE ** change all react router Link with react-router-dom, both reserve the Link keyword
    
    - I want the search bar on every page but only on the homepge to load events, 
    that way the user can use the search bar in his profile to search other things 

    - react -helmet causes an error if you load components with it in app with reat-router-dom

    - css rules for z-index-
        --logo z-index 100; register pages z-index 10

TODO - Mar 3
    - create a searchbar error dispatch action and send the result to state, log the error in forms 
    - use user auth at local storage to remember state
