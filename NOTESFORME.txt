Searchbar not working due to api not working 

-change all react router Link with react-router-dom, both reserve the Link keyword
    and are causing conflict in styled components
    -search bar is being rendered twice on app container and on header

    I want the search bar on every page but only on the homepge to load events, 
    that way the user can use the search bar in his profile to search other things
